# Virtual-Canvas

Painting the screen in real time with different colors and also erasing it, using the landmarks of the fingers from the mediapipe modules.

## MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines. With MediaPipe, a perception pipeline can be built as a graph of modular components, including, for instance, inference models (e.g., TensorFlow, TFLite) and media processing functions.
